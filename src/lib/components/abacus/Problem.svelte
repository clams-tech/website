		<ul class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold leading-8 list-decimal list-inside flex flex-col gap-3">
			<li>Document all your taxable cryptocurrency transactions for the year.</li>
			<li>
				Classify each transaction to ascertain whether it falls under income or capital gains
				taxation.
			</li>
			<li>Identify the initial cost of each cryptocurrency transaction (cost basis).</li>
			<li>Compute your gains, losses, and overall income.</li>
			<li>Communicate these details in your reporting.</li>
		</ul>

			Data can be imported into the app in two ways: through automatic sync or manual import.
			Currently, our first integration for auto-sync is Core Lightning, and we plan to support many
			more wallets very soon. In the meantime, if you're not a CLN user, please take advantage of
			the manual import tool.

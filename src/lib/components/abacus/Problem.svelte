		<ul class="mt-6 text-lg font-bold leading-8 list-decimal list-inside flex flex-col gap-3">
			<li>Document all your taxable cryptocurrency transactions for the year.</li>
			<li>
				Classify each transaction to ascertain whether it falls under income or capital gains
				taxation.
			</li>
			<li>Identify the initial cost of each cryptocurrency transaction (cost basis).</li>
			<li>Compute your gains, losses, and overall income.</li>
			<li>Communicate these details in your reporting.</li>
		</ul>

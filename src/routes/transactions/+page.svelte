				The Transactions Dashboard offers a comprehensive display of all balance updates across your
				various connections. Utilizing advanced filtering capabilities, you can precisely isolate
				specific updates for closer examination. For instance, if you wish to look at on-chain
				balance changes that resulted from channel closures within the past month, this will be
				effortless. Similarly, investigating lightning payments received by a particular node in the
				last week can be done with ease. By clicking on a transaction entry, you will be directed to
				a dedicated page with more advanced details.

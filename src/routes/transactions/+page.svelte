				The Transactions feature provides a comprehensive overview of all balance changes across
				your wallets, spanning a specific time frame. Using advanced filtering options, you can
				precisely isolate particular updates for in-depth analysis. For example, if you want to
				review on-chain balance adjustments resulting from channel closures within the past month,
				it's a straightforward process. Likewise, investigating lightning payments received by a
				specific node in the last week is effortless. By clicking on a transaction entry, you'll be
				directed to a dedicated page with more detailed information.

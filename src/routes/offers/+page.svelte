				Clams is at the forefront of BOLT12 adoption, a groundbreaking payment format for Lightning.
				A dedicated dashboard allows node operators to effortlessly create and manage offers,
				generating static invoices for seamless payment acceptance and convenient withdrawals. There
				are a whole host of potential use cases for offers, from reusable QR codes on your coffee
				shop tip jar to allowing customers to receive a refund from your online store. It's worth
				noting that this feature is presently available exclusively for Core Lightning nodes.
				However, as the adoption of BOLT12 gains momentum within the ecosystem, Clams eagerly
				anticipates integrating support for a wider array of implementations.

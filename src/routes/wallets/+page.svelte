				The Wallets feature acts as a central hub for managing connections to your nodes. Once a
				connection is established, data synchronization begins. Power users that manage multiple
				nodes can connect them all, allowing them to seamlessly sync data from different sources.
				For example, you might have one node for personal matters and another for business
				transactions. With Clams, you can gain insights and control over both once both nodes are
				connected. Node operators always maintain full control through customizable permissions,
				ranging from read-only to full administrative control. Access to nodes is available for as
				long as needed, secured by a strong password of your choice.

				The dedicated Channels Dashboard offers an array of monitoring capabilities, enabling you to
				oversee each individual channel you've established across all of your connected lightning
				nodes. This dashboard will proves very valuable in swiftly gauging the status of your
				liquidity profile concerning your off-chain Bitcoin holdings. For instance, you might
				encounter challenges in receiving payments through one of your CLN nodes. To diagnose and
				address any issues, you can seamlessly transition to this dashboard, organize your channels
				based on nodes, and then focus on assessing your inbound liquidity. Throughout this process,
				you might uncover that your inbound liquidity is adequate, but certain channels are in a
				state of failure. Identifying these types of issues allows you to promptly take appropriate
				corrective actions.

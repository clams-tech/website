			In alignment with the movement to empower users with more control over their data, Clams takes
			a user-centric approach by storing all user data locally on their device. When you first use
			Clams, you will be prompted to create a secure password. This password is utilized to encrypt
			your data, ensuring its security. The same password will be required for data decryption when
			transferring data between devices. Just as Bitcoin provides improved custody of your wealth,
			our aim with Clams is to offer a similar level of security for your associated data. Exporting
			data is straightforward, and clearing all data from any device is equally simple.
